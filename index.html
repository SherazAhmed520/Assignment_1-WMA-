<p>" <b>Saylani Welfare Trust</b> is a name that needs no introduction today. <br/>
The journey this team embarked upon was made possible owing to their zeal, <br/>
enthusiasm & commitment to the society and by the grace of <strong>Allah (SWT)</strong>, <br/>
it has become a name that we need and not just the one we want. <br/>
<i> I</i> wish <b><em>Saylaniâ€™s team</em></b> all the success and blessing that they deserve for future, <br/>
May <b>God</b> bless Saylani and ensure 


<u>prosperity</u> and 


<u>happiness</u> 


for our people, <strong> Ameen!</strong>"
